paternalistic
                
- Location: 192
a policy is “paternalistic” if it tries to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves.
                
- Location: 194
in many cases, individuals make pretty bad decisions—decisions they would not have made if they
                
- Location: 194
had paid full attention and possessed complete information, unlimited cognitive abilities, and complete self-control.
                
- Location: 200
A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.
                
- Location: 202
intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid.
                
- Location: 208
Those who reject paternalism often claim that human beings do a terrific
                
- Location: 209
job of making choices, and if not terrific, certainly better than anyone else would do (especially if that someone else works for the government).

They are not homo economicus; they are homo sapiens. To keep our Latin usage to a minimum we will hereafter refer to these imaginary and real species as Econs and Humans.

reject the claim that all or almost all Americans are choosing their diet optimally. What is true for diets is true for other risk-related behavior,
                
- Location: 226
research has raised serious questions about the rationality of many judgments and decisions that people make.
                
- Location: 229
Unlike Econs, Humans predictably err.

- Location: 231
Hundreds of studies confirm that human forecasts are flawed and biased.
                
- Location: 232
Human decision making is not so great either.

“status quo bias,”
                
- Location: 238
First, never underestimate the power of inertia. Second, that power can be harnessed.
                
- Location: 240
setting default options, and other similar seemingly trivial menu-changing strategies, can have huge effects on outcomes,
                
- Location: 242
In accordance with our definition, a nudge is any factor that significantly alters the behavior of Humans, even though it would be ignored by Econs. Econs respond primarily to incentives.
                
Note:This is a key definition, in terms of operationalizing the modeling of nudges vs. incentives or regulations. A nudge does not alter the objective function, or the constraint, of an idealized economic agent. Thus it does not alter the outcome for such an "Econ" and would not violate neoclassical conditions for economic efficiency.
- Location: 245
By properly deploying both incentives and nudges, we can improve
                
- Location: 246
our ability to improve people’s lives, and help solve many of society’s major problems.
                
- Location: 249
The standard policy advice that stems from this way of thinking is to give people as many choices as possible, and then let them choose the one they like best (with as little government intervention or nudging as possible).
                
- Location: 252
Just Maximize Choices has become a policy mantra.
                
- Location: 255
skeptical about nudges. We believe that their skepticism is based on a false assumption and two misconceptions.
                
- Location: 255
The false assumption is that almost all people, almost all of the time, make choices that are in their best interest or at the very least are better than the choices that would be made by someone else.
                
- Location: 259
In many areas, ordinary consumers are novices, interacting in a world inhabited by experienced professionals
                
- Location: 261
It seems reasonable to say that people make good choices in contexts in which they have experience, good information, and prompt feedback—say, choosing among ice cream flavors.
                
- Location: 263
They do less well in contexts in which they are inexperienced and poorly informed, and in which feedback is slow or infrequent—say,
                
- Location: 268
The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices.
                
- Location: 271
people’s choices are pervasively influenced by the design elements selected by choice architects.
                
- Location: 283
In this respect, the antinudge position is unhelpful—a literal nonstarter.
                
- Location: 284
The second misconception is that paternalism always involves coercion.
                
- Location: 290
by insisting that choices remain unrestricted, we think that the risks of inept or even corrupt designs are reduced. Freedom to choose is the best safeguard against bad choice architecture.
                
- Location: 335
Libertarian paternalism, we think, is a promising foundation for bipartisanship.
                
- Location: 336
we will be arguing that better governance requires less in the way of government coercion and constraint, and more in the way of freedom to choose. If incentives and nudges replace requirements and bans, government will be both smaller and more modest. So, to be clear: we are not for bigger government, just for better governance.
                
- Location: 356
*Alert readers will notice that incentives can come in different forms. If steps are taken to increase people’s cognitive effort—as by placing fruit at eye level and candy in a more obscure place—it might be said that the “cost” of choosing candy is increased. Some of our nudges do, in a sense, impose cognitive (rather than material) costs, and in that sense alter incentives. Nudges count as such, and qualify as libertarian paternalism, only if any costs are low.
                
- Location: 382
These two figures capture the key insight that behavioral economists have borrowed from psychologists.
                
- Location: 385
our understanding of human behavior can be improved by appreciating how people systematically go wrong.
                
- Location: 393
distinction between two kinds of thinking, one that is intuitive and automatic, and another that is reflective and rational.
                
- Location: 394
We will call the first the Automatic System and the second the Reflective System.
                
- Location: 401
Automatic System Reflective System Uncontrolled Controlled Effortless Effortful Associative Deductive Fast Slow Unconscious Self-aware Skilled Rule-following
                
- Location: 416
Gut feelings can be quite accurate, but we often make mistakes because we rely too much on our Automatic System.
                
- Location: 444
We use rules of thumb because most of the time they are quick and useful.
                
- Location: 448
Although rules of thumb can be very helpful, their use can also lead to systematic biases. This insight, first developed decades ago by two Israeli psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974),
                
- Location: 450
Their original work identified three heuristics, or rules of thumb—anchoring, availability, and representativeness—and the biases that are associated with each.
                
- Location: 454
Anchoring
                
- Location: 459
process is called “anchoring and adjustment.” You start with some anchor, the number you know, and adjust in the direction you think is appropriate.
                
- Location: 461
The bias occurs because the adjustments are typically insufficient.
                
- Location: 475
anchors serve as nudges.
                
- Location: 475
We can influence the figure you will choose in a particular situation by ever-so-subtly suggesting a starting point for your thought process.
                
- Location: 482
Availability
                
- Location: 485
In answering questions of this kind, most people use what is called the availability heuristic. They assess the likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind. If people can easily think of relevant examples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they cannot.
                
- Location: 489
Accessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well.
                
- Location: 493
So, too, recent events have a greater impact on our behavior,
                
- Location: 494
The availability heuristic helps to explain much risk-related behavior,
                
- Location: 508
Representativeness
                
- Location: 509
The third of the original three heuristics bears an unwieldy name: representativeness. Think of it as the similarity heuristic. The idea is that when asked to judge how likely it is that A belongs to category B, people (and especially their Automatic Systems) answer by asking themselves how similar A is to their image or stereotype of B
                
- Location: 525
homunculus is the Automatic System in action.
                
- Location: 547
Gilovich (with colleagues Vallone and Tversky [1985]) is also responsible for perhaps the most famous (or infamous) example of misperception of randomness, namely the widely held view among basketball fans that there is a strong pattern of “streak shooting.”
                
- Location: 581
use of the representativeness heuristic can cause people to confuse random fluctuations with causal patterns.
                
- Location: 582
Optimism and Overconfidence
                
- Location: 596
People are unrealistically optimistic even when the stakes are high.
                
- Location: 599
(Second marriage, Samuel Johnson once quipped, “is the triumph of hope over experience.”)
                
- Location: 604
Unrealistic optimism can explain a lot of individual risk taking, especially in the domain of risks to life and health.
                
- Location: 610
Unrealistic optimism is a pervasive feature of human life; it characterizes most people in most social categories.
                
- Location: 613
Gains and Losses
                
- Location: 614
Roughly speaking, losing something makes you twice as miserable as gaining the same thing makes you happy. In more technical language, people are “loss averse.”
                
- Location: 622
What this means is that people do not assign specific values to objects. When they have to give something up, they are hurt more than they are pleased if they acquire the very same thing.
                
- Location: 625
This implies that the prospect of winning $200 just offsets the prospect of losing $100.
                
Note:Q: To what extent, or in what situations, are loss-aversion and status-quo bias implied by risk aversion?
- Location: 626
Loss aversion helps produce inertia, meaning a strong desire to stick with your current holdings.
                
- Location: 631
Status Quo Bias
                
- Location: 632
Loss aversion is not the only reason for inertia. For lots of reasons, people have a more general tendency to stick with their current situation.
                
- Location: 633
This phenomenon, which William Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser (1988) have dubbed the “status quo bias,”
                
- Location: 646
One of the causes of status quo bias is a lack of attention.
                
- Location: 654
Default options thus act as powerful nudges.
                
- Location: 657
Framing
                
- Location: 667
Framing matters in many domains.
                
- Location: 674
“framing.” The idea is that choices depend, in part, on the way in which problems are stated.
                
- Location: 677
information campaign (b), framed in terms of losses, is far more effective than information campaign (a).
                
- Location: 678
Framing works because people tend to be somewhat mindless, passive decision makers.
                
- Location: 682
picture that emerges is one of busy people trying to cope in a complex world in which they cannot afford to think deeply about every choice they have to make. People adopt sensible rules of thumb that sometimes lead them astray. Because they are busy and have limited attention, they accept questions as posed rather than trying to determine whether their answers would vary under alternative formulations.
                
- Location: 720
group is said to display behavior that is dynamically inconsistent. Initially people prefer A to B, but they later choose B over A.
                

Note | Location: 721
Not sure this captures the essence of dynamic inconsistency, which is not simply a change of preferences over time. Is in not the ex-post abrogation of a dynamic plan?
- Location: 723
temptation and mindlessness.
                
- Location: 729
We will call something “tempting” if we consume more of it when hot than when cold.
                
- Location: 732
Most people realize that temptation exists, and they take steps to overcome it. The classic example is that of Ulysses, who faced the peril of the Sirens and their irresistible songs.
                
- Location: 736
For most of us, however, self-control issues arise because we underestimate the effect of arousal. This is something the behavioral economist George Loewenstein (1996) calls the “hot-cold empathy gap.” When
                
- Location: 738
in a cold state, we do not appreciate how much our desires and our behavior will be altered when we are “under the influence” of arousal. As a result, our behavior reflects a certain naïveté about the effects that context can have on choice.
                
- Location: 744
Self-control problems can be illuminated by thinking about an individual as containing two semiautonomous selves, a far-sighted “Planner” and a myopic “Doer.”
                
- Location: 746
You can think of the Planner as speaking for your Reflective System, or the Mr. Spock lurking within you, and the Doer as heavily influenced by the Automatic System, or everyone’s Homer Simpson.
                
- Location: 752
Mindless Choosing
                
- Location: 753
In many situations, people put themselves into an “automatic pilot” mode, in which they are not actively paying attention to the task at hand. (The Automatic System is very comfortable that way.)
                
- Location: 757
Eating turns out to be one of the most mindless activities we do.
                
- Location: 772
When self-control problems and mindless choosing are combined, the result is a series of bad outcomes for real people.
                
- Location: 776
Self-Control Strategies
                
- Location: 777
make lists
                
- Location: 778
buy an alarm clock
                
- Location: 778
ask friends to stop us
                
- Location: 779
In these cases, our Planners are taking steps to control the actions of our Doers, often by trying to change the incentives that Doers face.
                
- Location: 791
In daily life, one strategy involves informal bets.
                
- Location: 804
The scheme worked because the pain of having Thaler cash the check and consume some good wine without him was more salient
                
- Location: 807
Sometimes friends can adopt such betting strategies together.
                
- Location: 815
More formal versions of these strategies are easy to imagine.
                
- Location: 831
Companies can make a lot of money by strengthening Planners in their battle with Doers, often doing well by doing good.
                
- Location: 860
Another way to approach these problems is to adopt internal control systems, otherwise known as mental accounting.
                
- Location: 926
Econs are not followers of fashion.
                
- Location: 929
Humans are not exactly lemmings, but they are easily influenced by the statements and deeds of others.
                
- Location: 936
we try to understand how and why social influences work.
                
- Location: 937
First, most people learn from others. This is usually good, of course.
                
- Location: 939
The second reason why this topic is important for our purposes is that one of the most effective ways to nudge (for good or evil) is via social influence.
                
- Location: 944
Social influences come in two basic categories. The first involves information.
                
- Location: 946
The second involves peer pressure. If you care about what other people think about you
                
- Location: 960
The bottom line is that Humans are easily nudged by other Humans. Why? One reason is that we like to conform.
                
- Location: 961
Doing What Others Do
                
- Location: 974
Asch’s findings seem to capture something universal about humanity. Conformity experiments have been replicated and extended in more than 130 experiments from seventeen countries,
                
- Location: 990
we are particularly interested in how people are influenced, or can be influenced, in dealing with problems that are both hard and unfamiliar.
                
- Location: 996
Here the individual judgments converged and a group norm, establishing the consensus distance, quickly developed.
                
- Location: 999
seemingly similar groups, cities, and even nations can converge on very different beliefs and actions simply because of modest and even arbitrary variations in starting points.
                
- Location: 1,004
The clear lesson here is that consistent and unwavering people, in the private or public sector, can move groups and practices in their preferred direction.
                
- Location: 1,012
many groups fall prey to what is known as “collective conservatism”: the tendency of groups to stick to established patterns even as new needs arise. Once a practice (like wearing ties) has become established, it is likely to be perpetuated, even if there is no particular basis for it.
                
Note:This is the message of the story of "The Ashram's Cat," traditions that are perpetuated for no obvious reasons. e.g. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gurus-cat-jenny-loh
- Location: 1,064
The moral is that people are paying less attention to you than you believe.
                
- Location: 1,065
But in part because people do think that everyone has their eyes fixed on them, they conform to what they think people expect.
