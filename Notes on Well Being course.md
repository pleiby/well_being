Notes on Well Being
====================
- Course by Prof. Laurie Santos, Yale

## Course Outline: Five Lectures
1. Misconceoptions About Happiness (our goals are not going to make us as happy as we think)
2. Why our Expectations are So Bad (biases that lead you astray)
3. What Stuff Really Increases Happiness
4. Strategies to Reset Our Expectations
5. Putting Strategies Into Practice


## Week 01
- G.I. Joe Fallacy: Mistaken Idea that "Knowing is Half the Battle." 
    - Fallacy of G.I. Joe public service announcements to kids, followed by "Now you know... And knowing is half the battle."
    - but merely knowing something is not enough to change your behavior
    - e.g. knowing something is an illusion does not prevent you from seeing it.
    - See Santos & Gendler (2014). [Knowing is half the battle?](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25436) Edge.
- in terms of improving Well Being, knowing about research and approaches is needed, but achieving it needs commitment, group-support, and practice

#### Happiness Measures

- PERMA (an acronym for Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment
Yale Qualtrics Survey Tool, 2021/05/14

        Your PERMA results are: (take 2) 
        Positive emotions = 7.33 
        Engagement = 7.67 
        Relationships = 8.33 
        Meaning = 7 
        Accomplishment = 6.67
        Health = 7.67 
        Negative emotions = 2 
        Loneliness = 1 
        Overall Well-Being = 7.38 

        Your PERMA results are: (take 1)
        Positive emotions = 6.33 
        Engagement = 7.67 
        Relationships = 8.33 
        Meaning = 6.67 
        Accomplishment = 5.33
        Health = 7.67 
        Negative emotions = 2.33 
        Loneliness = 0 
        **PERMA Overall Well-Being = 6.88** 

- Authentic Happiness Inventory

- [Use Your Strengths to Boost Happiness - Via Institure](https://www.viacharacter.org/topics/articles/use-your-strengths-to-boost-happiness)

#### Ideas for Using Signature Strengths in New Way for Rewiring Exercise (from VIA Institute)
10) Love
    - Surprise somebody with a small gift that shows you care (e.g., flowers, a Starbucks coffee).
    - Tell someone about a strength you saw them use and how much you value it. Words of affirmation are a powerful, verbal force for the expression of love.
2) Curiosity
    - Try a new food for the first time, preferably from a culture different than your own.
    - Take a different route home and explore a new area or neighborhood.
    - ask one of your co-workers a question you have not previously asked them.
    - as you do one household chore (e.g., washing the dishes, vacuuming), pay attention to 3 novel features of the activity while you do it. 
8) Honesty
    - Write a poem that expresses an inner truth.
    - Contact a family member or friend whom you have told a “partial” truth and give them the complete details.
4) Love of Learning
    - Read some of the original works of Gandhi online.
    - Consider your favorite subject matter. Do an Internet search and surprise yourself by discovering something new about the topic.
16) Forgiveness
    - Let go of a minor irritant or a grudge.
    - Give yourself permission to make a mistake.

-----------------------------------

## Week 02
#### R. Emmons, Power of Gratitude
- gratitude has power to heal, energize and change lives
- gratitude:
    - affirmation of goodness (not perfection) in life
    - making an attribute to, recognition of, source(s) of goodness. Gratefulness to that source.
- being grateful as an attitude or way of life
- **grateful person** is able to accept all of life as a gift, or potential gift (vs. life as a burden)
- satisfaction vs. deprivation
    - grateful people become more generous, outgoing, helpful
    - because reciprocity is such a universal norm. Grateful people will return gifts

#### Gratitude
- benefits
    - increase mood
    - lower stress levels
    - decrease blood pressure
    - feel stronger social connect
- Approach
    - write things down
    - take picture
    - take time to experience gratitude and appreciate
#### Savoring
- Savoring = stepping out of your experience, to review and appreciate it while it's happening.
- "Savoring is about focusing on the positive aspects of an experience and thinking about sharing the positive experience with others enhances savoring.?
- savoring benefits
    - thwarts hedonic adaptation
    - thwarts mind-wandering
    - promotes gratitude

#### Things we Think Will Make Us Happy But Don't (Everything You Thought Was Important for Being Happy Isn't)
1. Good Job (high pay, that you care abourt)
    - Gilbert et al 1998 showed that actual unhappiness for not getting job was much less that candidate predicted ex ante
    - LinkedIn survey put compensation as single most important criterion for new grads looking for a job
        - but how much is enough?
    - Lyubomirsky (How of Happiness) asked about How Much salary do you need to be happy, found there was no stable objective number, it shifted up as more was earned.
        - $30k earners wanted $50k
        - $100k earners wanted $250k
2. Money - will wealth make you happy
    - Ed Diener looked at correlation between "life satisfaction" and income
        - Diener "Unlocking the Mysteries of Psychological Wealth"
        - two worldwide samples 
            - (World Value Survey). Correlations by country are -0.02 to 0.21
            - College Sruvey correlations from -0.04 to 0.24 (mostly higher for poorer nations)
        - mean correlation is about 0.10
        - implication: once basic needs statisfied, extra money does not help very much with satisfaction
    - Longitudinal Surveys
        - US life satisfaction lower since 1940s despite substantially greater material wealth
    - David Myers _American Paradox: Social Hunger in an Age of Plenty_ much more affluence, slightly less happiness, greater risk for depression
    - Daniel  Kahneman and Agnes Deacon looked for "income threshold for happiness"
        - threshold in income, above which do not get much increase in happiness
        - considered range of 3 measures of life satisfaction, surveyed 450000 Americans in 2008
            - Positive affect/behavior; Reported Not-Blue/Sad-Worried; Reported Stress Free
        - found positive effect of income on all three measures of life-satisfaction up to a threshold of about $75k ($50-80k)
        - find "EWB [Emotional Well Being] rises with income, but no progress after income > $75K
        - however, reported "Life Evaluation" measure continues increasing monotonically with income, at least up to $250K 
            - Kahneman & Deaton (2010). High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being. PNAS, 107(38), 16489-16493.
        - So: High income does't imply greater measured happiness, but it does lead to a life that people report as "better"
- Does money make us happier? A: Maybe a little bit, but way less than we actually think.

3. Awesome Stuff, True Love, Perfect Body, Good Grades
- Awesome Stuff: material goods, house, car, pool
    - Longituding studies (comparing 2010 vs 1940s) suggests that material goods/wealth do not increase happiness
    - thinking about stuff (matierialist attitudes) makes us worse off 
        - Nickerson et al 2003 reported those with materialist attitudes had lower life satisfation 20 years later
    - Awesome stuff does not really make us happier and seeking it out makes us less happy
- True love:
    - Lucas 2013 looked at Marriage and Happiness: are married people happier
        - 25000 people surveyed for 15 years; 1716 got married
        - Find married people happier in year 1-2, but no happier after that (Honeymoon Effect)
            - Doesn't Gilbert report something different?
        - Clark et al 2003 for German data show same thing for 2 years +/- marriage
- Perfect Face/Body: Consider Body Weight
    - Jackson et al 2014 study of ~2000 obese individuals who lost/gained/maintained same weight
    - found all groups were more depressed, but worst effect was for those who lost weight
    - Von Soest et al 2011 looked at cosmetic surgery
- Good Grades
    - Levine et al 2012 show very effect on happiness after learning grades are higher or lower than expected, and actual effect of grade outcome on happiness is very much smnaller than predicted ex ante

#### Why We have Misconceptions
- We are "clueless" about what _will_ make us happy
- Why - two possible and wrong answers: genetic predisposition to happiness and conflicting circumstances [other conflicting things happening changing happiness outcomes]
    - S. Lyubomirsky _How of Happiness_: "genes and circumstances don't matter as much for happiness as we think"
    - research on twins and those with catastrophes
    - Lyubomirsky concludes: 
        - genetic setpoint 50% (a substantial amount, but "only about 50%")
        - circumstances (life happens) 10% (surprisingly small influence)
        - actions and thoughts 40% 
            - Under out control (intentions, efforts)
            - Lyubomirsky: "Out intentional, effortful activities have a powerful effect on how happy we are, over and above the effects of our setpoints and the circumstances in which we find ourselves"
    - we can work hard to be happier. 
    - the problem is that we seem to be working toward the wrong things 
        - (most of the goals we think will make us happy, will not really make us happy)

#### Annoying Features of the Mind That Lead Us Astray:
1. our minds strongest intuitions are often totally wrong
    - (particularly about happiness, but also about what is correct, what we perceive, etc.)

- We are all mis-predicting how we will feel (errors/biases in Affective Forecasting)
    - Durability Bias: Gilbert et al. (1998). Immune neglect: A source of durability bias in affective forecasting. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, 617-638.

## Week 03 

### Annoying Features of the Mind (why our expectations are so bad regarding how we will feel)

Why we then have so much "Miswanting" (Wilson and Gilbert)

#### Annoying Feature #1 Our monds strongest intuitions are often wrong (we just misperceive things)
#### Annoying Feature #2. Our miond does not think in absolutes, is constantly jusdging _relative_ to _reference points_
- whatever your counterfactural is, its affecting your happioness
- reference points are commonly something relatively better than your own current condition, or the condition of others
#### Annoying Feature #3. Our mind is built to grow accustomed to conditions: (hedonic adaptation and habituation)
#### Annoying Feature #4. "Impact Bias" (Gilbert): we overestimate both the magnitude and duration of the impact of outcomes on happiness
- events have far less impact (intensity and duration) on happiness than we expect
- This is true for both positive and negative impacts
- But the overestimation of the magnitude of negative impacts on happiness is even greater.
- Reason:
    - Part of this is due to the "Focal" effect, where we do not consider other, compensating or distraction conditions that will occur, outside the focal event uncertainty of interest.
    - Part of this is because we don't realize that our mind can/will adapt/habituate to many conditions

#### Notes [Dan Gilbert’s TED Talk - The surprising science of happiness](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_the_surprising_science_of_happiness#t-871082) Feb 2004
- Gilbert: "impact bias" is in part attributable to "synthetic happiness": 
    - synthetic happiness: humans have the ability to change their view of the world to be more satisfied with it.
    - but we don't realize it
    - Secret of Happiness: Accrue wealth power, and prestige, then lose it!
    - we smirk because we think synthetic happiness is inferior to natural or real happiness
        - natural/real happiness: when we get what we wanted
        - synthetic happiness: what we make when we don;t get what we want.
    - Gilbert says synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as real happiness
- Happiness synthesis: After the fact, What I got is better than I every realized. The outcome I didn't get sucks.
    - Freedom to choose is the friend of natural happiness, but the enemy of synthetic happiness.
    - Synthetic Happiness: "Helping people to accept the things they cannot change."
    - Synthetic Happiness is a "psychological immune system"
- "The unanticipated joy of being totally stuck"
    - study reversible choices vs. irreversible choices
    - people with irreversible choices underpredict the increase in future happiness/satisfaction with their choice by a large margin
    - people with reversible choices overpredict their future happiness/satisfaction with their choice, in fact their satisfaction declines
    - But, interestingly, ex ante people say they prefer the situation of a reversible choice, rather than irreversible.
        - yet "the reversible condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness."
- effect bias in literature
    - "there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so." Shakespeare (overstated)
    - "The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another. Some of those situations may no doubt deserve to be preferred to others, but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules of either prudence or of justice, or to corrupt the future tranquiity of our minds by either shame from remembrance of our own folly or remorse from the horror of our own injustice." Adam Smith
- Summary (Gilbert)
    - "We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. 
        - But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk. 
    - When our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully. 
        - When our ambition is unbounded, it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others, to sacrifice things of real value. 
    - When our fears are bounded, we're prudent, we're cautious, we're thoughtful. 
        - When our fears are unbounded and overblown, we're reckless, and we're cowardly. 
    - The lesson I want to leave you with, from these data, is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown, because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience." 

## Week 04

### Behavioral Strateties in Response to Recognition of Hedonic Adaptation (that reduces subjective happiness)
- 1. Investing in experiences rather than "stuff" (for which hedonic adaptation is greater)
    - leads to greater post-consumption happiness (lower Hedonic Adaptation)
    - Value of experience (or purchase) can be inhanced by focusing anticipatory/planning period
        - Kumar et al 2014 find anticipatory contemplation is more effective at creating excitement for prospective experience than material purchase; and anticiption is more pleasant for experiences than material purchases (material purchases more likely to lead to impatience)
    - counting down to experiences 
    - Q: Can we differentiate among types of stuff/material goods, to focus on those for which Hedonic Adaptations is lesser
    - Behavioral/Perceptual Problem: People commonly overestimate post-event (post-consumption) happiness for material goods and underestimate post-consumption happiness for experiential goods. (Pchelin & Howell 2014). People's intuition/expectations are biased/erroneous
    - Experiential purposes also better ex post because you can more easily share them (other people are more interested in hearing about them, resonate with them better). 
    - Experiences are less susceptible to social comparison
        - if we invest in experiences, those events, and we, are less subject to comparison, by us or others.
- 2. Forestalling Hedonic Apaptations by Various Strategy
### Strategies Forestalling or Tharting Hedonic Adaptation (HA)
#### 1. Savoring to maximize appreciation/enjoyment, and forestall HA
#### 2. Negative Visualization: thinking about what might have been without a good thing/event/outcome
#### 3. Imaging a day as your last 
- thinking about losing something highlights awareness/appreciation of good things)
#### 4. Gratitude: Powerful means of Thwarting Hedonic Adaptation (and setting your Reference Point)
- Thinking about Writing down Gratitude
    - writing things you are thankful for
    - See Emmons and McCullough 2010: Write 5 things you are grateful for, each week
    - Control & Alternative groups thought about and 5 Events, or any 5 Hassles
    - Gratitude improved subjective well-being: Attitude toward Life as a Whole; Improved Outlook for Upcoming Week; Reduced reported Negative Physical Symptoms; Increased Hours of Exercise
- Sharing Gratitude
    - Writing letter of gratitude and physically deliver (see Seligman et al. 2005)
    - can increase subjective well-being for months

### Strategies to Reset Your Reference Points
- Reference Point: (Often) Irrelevant Standard by which we compare our situations or outcomes
- Reference Points affect our happiness judgements all the time
- E.g. Due to non-independence of irrelevant of alternatives, perceived happiness in a situation depends on the arbitrary (and possibly unavailable) alternatives to which you may be comparing the situation

#### 1. Concretetly Re-experiencing
- An improved situation may become familiar and taken for granted (become the new reference point)
- If so, Go back an re-experience your old reference point (e.g. if it was inferior, so that it can be properly compared with your new reference point?)
    - do this by revisiting, or taking time to use your imagination to recall reality of previous situation
    - this can return your previous situation to your reference point (rather than your new situation that you have become adapted to)

#### 2. Concretely Observe the Alternative
- Explicitly visit/revisit an alternative situation/reference point that is not as good as yours
- To see practical difficulties/problems with the alternative

#### 3. Avoid Social Comparisons
- The Stop alternative
- Go back to practice of gratitute, to avoid social comparisons (gratitude is a killer of envy)
- Be conscious of the social reference points you are letting in (in terms of body, salary)
- cancel/suspend your social media accounts

#### 4. Interrupt Your Consumption
- Can reset your reference point and avoid hedonic adaptation
- Interrupt the good times (space out the good events), to better appreciate them
- Nelsom & Mevis 2008 show value of break in consumption (of music) for re-increasing value
    - TV sitcoms are actually more enjoyable with commercial breaks
- So think about your consumption split the thing you enjoy in life
    - conversely, best to condense bad activities into one session as much as possible

#### 5. Increase Your Variety (of activities and consumption)
- breaks up adaptation and changes reference point

### Review of Cognitive Biases that Cause Miswanting, and Strategic Responses
#### Cognitive Biases Lead to Miswanting (Alter our Choices and Undermine Happiness)
- Or strongest intuitions are wrong: Thinks things will be better than they are
- Think in terms of relative comparisons, rather than absolute
- Hedonic Adaptation: Get used to things even though we don't believe we will
#### Intentional Strategies (Habits) can address these
- Especially can address the first 2
    - Resetting your reference points
    - Thwarting your adaptation
- These will be effortful
- But have not addressed: Strongest intuitions (about things that we want) are wrong

## Week 05
- Review: 
    - we are subject to miswanting: we tend to want the wrong things
    - we think we want certain things, but after working for them, we don't get as much out of them as we thought
    - cognitive biases cause this
    - (effortful) strategies to address these cognitive biases
        - strategies to thwart hedonic adaptaion: savor; be grateful
        - strategies to reset reference points by which circumstances are evaluated, reframe things
    - remaining issue: are there better ways of wanting
        - How can we want the stuff that's really going to make us happy
        - Two parts
            1. wanting the right parts of the things that we already want
            2. new things that we will don't realize we want but will make us happy (be fulfilling?)
- seeking out jobs/situations that let you use your signature strengths
- character strengths: virtues in the way we act, that when followed lead to flourishing (see Martin Seligman, _Authentic Happiness_)
    1. ubiquitous recognized across different cultures
    2. fulfilling
    3. morally-valued
    4. not able to diminish others (non-rivalrous?)
    5. opposite of a negative trait
    6. trait-like
    7. measurable
    8. distinct (not redundant with other signature strengths)
    9. observable in paragons (people who are ideal examples of trait)
    10. observable in prodigies (people who show trait early in life)
    11. selective absence in some people
    12. institutionalized (valued by society, in schools, religious institutions)
- Seligman came up with a set of 24 Character Strengths (measured by the "Virtues in Action" Character Strength test)
    - appreciation of beauty
    - bravery
    - citizenship
    - creativity
    - curiousity
    - fairness
    - forgiveness and mercy
    - gratitude
    - hope
    - humor
    - integrity
    - judgement
    - kindness
    - leadership
    - love
    - love of learning
    - modesty and humility
    - persistence
    - perspective
    - prudence
    - self-regulation
    - social intelligence
    - sprituality
    - zest
- Signature Strengths = Character Strengths that we show we care the most about [so far]
    - the Character Strengths that are most essential to who we are
    - but should we not seek to add new Character Strengths?
    - Seligman (2005) recommends: use one of your signature strengths in a new/different way every day
        - his studies showed this increased happiness measures and decreased depressive symptoms
    - Lavy and Littman-Odavia (2016) found that people using their signature strenghts more in job increases productivity and job satisfaction (mediated by positive emotions)
        - using sig strength more intentionally makes job more fun and more satisfying
        - Harzur and Ruch 2012 find number of signature strengths applied increases job satisfaction (positive experiences at work) and tendency to call job a "calling"
- **Two Factors Known to Make Jobs Satisfying**
    1. Utilize multiple Signature Strengths
    2. Jobs that give experience of "Flow:"
        - Mihaly Chikszentmihalyi book _Flow_: mental state of being fully immersed in activity, in the zone
- Features of Flow
    - feels challenging, but manageable
    - focused concentration on activity
    - that is intrinsically rewarding/worthwhile
    - serenity
    - loss of self-consciousness and time
- How to Achieve Flow
    - balance of challenge and the amount of skill you bring to it (at high skill and high challenge)

Skill\Chall | Low Challenge | Med Challenge | High Challenge
------------|---------------|---------------|---------------
Low Skill   | Apathy        | Worry         | Anxiety
Med Skill   | Boredom       |               | Arousal
High Skill  | Relaxation    | Control       | **Flow**

- Flow: "best moments usually occur if a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile" Chikszentmihalyi
- Note that we often choose, e.g. in free time, to do low-skill, low challenge activities (TV)

- What You Should Want in Context of Learning (studying/school, etc)
    - Seek to **Maintain a Growth Mindset** (this view is supported by neuroscience)
        - Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset
        - Fixed Mindset believes ability (intelligence, talent)( is fixed
            - things that require hard work or practice indicate a limited ability in that area
            - respond badly to poor outcomes and setbacks. Decrease in self-worth, loss of interest in area.
        - Growth Mindset believes improvement/growth possible with hard work). 
            - May take challenge and hard work as an opportunity to learn
            - Believe that hard work will pay off

- What should we want and Seek (are we under-wanting?
    1. Opportunities to be Kind
        - "One of the things that consistent work shows we should be seeking out more is opportunities to act more kindly to one another."
        - "We should be seeking out opportunities to do acts of kindness."
        - "empirical evidence is suggesting that simple acts of kindness bring us [reported] happiness"
            - Lyubomirsy et al. 2005
        - _Happy Money_ Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Morton 2008 tested happiness effect of spending money on others (vs. on self)
            - this result has been repeated in other cultures and economic segments
            - Q: does it matter whether you know the people that you are spending money on?
    2. Social Connections
        - value of "Opposite of Loneliness", Connectedness
        - Epley & Schroeder 2014 asked people to make Connections on transit vs Solitude vs. Control = Do Normal
            - found engaging/connection was most positive
            - found effect on recipients of engagement also felt more poitive about that than solitude
        - Boothby et al 2014 find enjoyment of chocolate increases when done around/with someone else
        - Miswanting Social Connection - discussion with Epley
            - Nick Epley, author of _Mindwise_ 
                - Mind Wise How We Understand What Others Think Would Believe and Feel and Want.
            - Finds that people miswant solitude, when his studies show they are happier with social connections (e.g. on transit)
                - people also, when asked, mispredicted that they would be more happy with solitude, and that the other people would be more happy when left alone.
                - people tend to systematically feel that other people are less interested in talking the them, than they are interested in talking with other people
            - findings apply to mis(under)wanting social connections with strangers as well as connections with people you know
            - Epley: "it turns out being social, being nice, even at just a very minimal level makes you feel happier."
            - Epley follow some recommendations
                - got rid of his smartphone
                - is much more willing to talk to people (everybody's got an interesting story to tell)
                - writes more gratitude letters
            - These behaviors improve happiness in the current time, but must be renewed:
                - " the way to think about these things and about happiness more generally it's like a leaky tire. You just kind of got to keep pumping air into it to keep it inflated." Epley
                - **Q: Any way to plug/slow the leak in this happiness tire?**
    3. Time Affluence
        - feeling like you have enough time to do the things you want
        - Whillans et al 2016: People that value time over money report greater happiness
        - Hirschfeld
            - More people (69%) value money than time
            - People who value time are happier
                - Mogliner 2021 find these spend more time on socializing than working (to earn money)
        - Investing in time affluence, thinking about having time as a form of affluence
            - "By focusing on [performance items] things like grades, and all the accolades you have to get to get a good job,and finding the perfect partner, and all those things, you're taking away from the free time "

#### 05 Continued - Mind Control - Limiting Mind Wandering
- Mind wanders 47% of the time (Killingsworth and Gilbert 2010)
- Region of brain used when mind wanders is called "default network"
    - what neuroscientists originally referred to as task unresponsive regions
- These regions are also related to regions generally activated when thinking about past or future, or about somebody else
- People are (self-reported) less happy when they are mind-wandering
- Gilbert: The ability to thing about what is not happening is a cognitive acheivement that comes at a cost
    - "A wandering mind is an unhappy mind."
- Define Meditation: "process of turning your mind away from distracting thoughts, to a focal point of reference"
    - improves reported happiness (in general life for a meditator)
    - Holzel et al. 2011 report increase in brain size (grey matter in certain region) after 8 weeks of mindfulness/stress-reduction meditation 
    - some boosts in cognitive performance (e.g. GREs, Mrazek et al. 2013)
    - Hutcherson et al 2018 observed positive effect of loving-kindness meditation on social closeness/connectedness.
#### 05 Continued - Healthy Practices
- Exercise
    - Hillman et al. 2008 review of how exercise improves cognitive performance
- Sleep
    - Improves stated well-being and cognitive performance
    - Huffington Post. [Lose Sleep, Lose Your Mind and Health](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/SleepDeprivation_0.png)

#### 05 Summary - Five things that we should want but don't often prioritize as highly
1. promoting kindness,
2. increasing social connection, 
3. finding time affluence (prioritizing (free) time),
4. meditation (thought/mind control: finding ways to control our thoughts so that we stay in the here and now,
5. healthy practices of sleep and exercise

## Week 06 How to Do That - Putting Strategies Into Practice
- GI Joe Fallacy: Knowing is not half the battle
- need strategies to put these things into practice
#### 06-02 Situational Support
    - pay attention to situation, find situations that support our efforts to do this
    - simple changes to situation can help (foo=d case is classic. see "Slim by Design", Painter et al 2002)
        - Proximity of distraction/temptation
    - so Design Environment to increase proximity and visibility of goal
        - remove reminders of affluence, electronic distractions
        - have gratitude journal handy/visible
        - have notes and reminders to meditate and exercise
    - engage people to help you with positive habits, and grow social connections
#### 06-02 Goal Setting
1. goal specificity ("SMART" crap)
2. spend time Goal Visualization by "Mental Contrasting": thinking about goal in terms of outcomes and obstacles
    - outcome expected and positive benefit (positive visualization)
    - also think about some of the obstacles to be overcome along the way
3. Goal Planning
    - plan for interventions in counterproductive situations
    - "Implementation Intention" is a self-regulatory strategy in the form of specific "If - then" rule that leads to better goal attainment (Peter Gollwitzer)

- Combined approach for Goals: WOOP - Wish, Outcomes, Obstacles and Plans
    - Duckworth et al. 2013 tested WOOP approach for school children
- Inteview with Gabriele Oettingen, author of _Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation_

## Rewirements
- Week 01 Rewirements: Measure Your Happiness and Discover Your Strengths
- Week 01 Measure your Baseline Happiness
    - Your first "assignment" is to **measure your current level of happiness using one or two validated psychological surveys. (PERMA or Authentic Happiness Survey)**
- Week 01 Find Your Signature Strengths
    - This week you will also have an opportunity to identify your character strengths, which we’ll learn more about in an upcoming lecture. Your character strengths are the positive parts of your personality that impact the way you think, feel and behave. To identify your strengths, take the free, online, research-based character strengths survey by the VIA Institute on Character. **Make sure to document your top 5 strengths.**
- Week 01 Use Your Signature Strengths
    - To get you into the practice of doing intentional and effortful activities to boost your own happiness, we want you to try to use your top strengths this week. **Each day for the following week, try to use your selected strength in a new way.**
- Week 02 Rewirements: Savoring & Gratitude
- Week 02 Savoring
    - Savoring is the act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it. Often we fail to stay in the moment and really enjoy what we’re experiencing. Savoring intensifies and lengthens the positive emotions that come with doing something you love. **For the next seven days, you will practice the art of savoring by picking one experience to truly savor each day.** It could be a nice shower, a delicious meal, a great walk outside, or any experience that you really enjoy. When you take part in this savored experience, be sure to practice some common techniques that enhance savoring. These techniques include: sharing the experience with another person, thinking about how lucky you are to enjoy such an amazing moment, keeping a souvenir or photo of that activity, and making sure you stay in the present moment the entire time. Every night, make a note of what you savored (Note: you can make a list in a notebook, use a notes app on your phone, use a calendar, or whatever works for you!). When you do write things down at the end of the day, be sure to take a moment to remember the activity.
- Week 02 Daily Gratitude Journal
    - Gratitude is a positive emotional state in which one recognizes and appreciates what one has received in life. Research shows that taking time to experience gratitude can make you happier and even healthier. **For the next seven days, you will take 5-10 minutes each night to write down five things for which you are grateful.** They can be little things or big things. But you really have to focus on them and actually write them down (Again, try to develop a tracking method works for you and utilize a note on your phone, a daily calendar, a special notebook, etc). You can just write a word or short phrase, but as you write these things down, take a moment to be mindful of the things you’re writing about (e.g., imagine the person or thing you’re writing about, etc.). This exercise should take at least five minutes. Do this each night for the whole week.
- Week 03 Rewirements: Kindness & Social Connection
- Week 03 Random Acts of Kindness
    - Research shows that happy people are motivated to do kind things for others. **Over the next seven days, you will perform seven acts of kindness beyond what you normally do.** You can do one extra act of kindness per day, or you can do a few acts of kindness in a single day. These do not have to be over-the-top or time-intensive acts, but they should be something that really helps or impacts another person. For example, help your colleague with something, give a few dollars or some time to a cause you believe in, say something kind to a stranger, write a thank you note, give blood, and so on. At the end of each day, list your random act of kindness. Just make sure you've finished seven total new acts of kindness by the end of the week.
- Week 03 Make A Social Connection 
    - **Over the next seven days, you will try to focus on making one new social connection per day.** It can be a small 5-minute act like sparking a conversation with someone on public transportation, asking a coworker about his/her day, or even chatting to the barista at a coffee shop. But you should also seek out more meaningful social connections, too. **At least once this week, take a whole hour to connect with someone you care about** — a friend who’s far away or a family member you haven’t talked to in a while.
- Week 04 Rewirements: Exercise & Sleep
- Week 04 Exercise
    - Research suggests that ~30 minutes a day of exercise can boost your mood in addition to making your body healthier. **For the next week, you will spend each day getting your body moving with at least 30 minutes of exercise.** Set aside a location and time (write it in your calendar!). Then hit the treadmill at the gym, do an online yoga class, or throw on some headphones and dance around your room to cheesy pop songs. This isn’t supposed to be a marathon-level of activity; it’s just to get your body moving a bit more than usual (Note: if you have physical limitations that prevent you from doing this weeks activity, do plan to skip it for obvious reasons). At the end of the day, make sure to log your activity. Be sure to take a moment to notice how much better you feel after getting some exercise in.
- Week 04 Sleep
    - Sleep! One of the reasons we’re so unhappy in our modern lives is that we’re consistently sleep deprived. Research shows that sleep can improve your mood more than we often expect. **For the next week, you must get at least seven hours of sleep for at least four nights of the next week.** ... Also be sure to practice good sleep hygiene too— no devices before bed and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol on the days you’re getting your sleep on. Each morning, be sure to log your amount of sleep in the tracking method you’ve been using for the rewirements. Make sure you get four nights of 7+ hours over the course of the week.
Week 05 Rewirements: Meditation & Gratitude Visit
Week 05 Meditate
    - Meditation is a practice of intentionally turning your attention away from distracting thoughts toward a single point of reference (e.g., the breath, bodily sensations, compassion, a specific thought, etc.). Research shows that meditation can have a number of positive benefits, including more positive moods, increased concentration, and more feelings of social connection. **For the next week, you will spend each (at least) 10 minutes per day meditating.** ... If you are new to meditation, you can try one of three guided meditations available on SoundCloud. And remember— meditation isn’t about the meditation itself; it’s about building a skill that we can use later. ... log when and how long you meditated in your preferred tracking system.
Week 06 Gratitude Letter/Visit
    - One of your last rewirements is one that research suggests will have a big impact on your happiness and that of another person. **This week, write a letter of gratitude to someone you care about.** For this assignment, think of one living person who has made a big difference in your life, but whom you never properly thanked. Then find a quiet spot when you have a half-hour free and write a heartfelt letter to that person explaining how he or she has touched your life and why he or she is meaningful to you. Your letter can be as long as you want, but try to make it at least 300 words or so. **Then you must deliver that letter to the person in question.** Just say you want to talk to that person without explaining why. You could read the letter to your chosen person over the phone or Skype, but for an extra huge happiness boost, we recommend scheduling a time to visit this person in person to share your letter. However you meet up, **you should read the letter aloud.**  We also recommend that you both have some tissues handy for this one. A gratitude letter is one of the most powerful tool for increasing happiness because it can forge social bonds and really change someone’s life.

Summary of Science of Well-Being Class by Laurie Santos, Yale
===============================================================

### Five Main Themes
1. Misconceoptions About Happiness (our goals are not going to make us as happy as we think)
2. Why our Expectations are So Bad (biases that lead you astray)
3. What Stuff Really Increases Happiness
4. Strategies to Reset Our Expectations
5. Putting Strategies Into Practice


### Things we Think Will Make Us Happy But Don't
1. Good Job (high pay, that you care abourt)
    - Gilbert et al 1998 showed that actual unhappiness for not getting job was much less that candidate predicted ex ante
    - Lyubomirsky (How of Happiness) found there was no stable objective salary numberd you need to be happy, , it shifted up as more was earned.
    - Many of our evaluations are _relative_, not absolute (Hedonic Treadmill)
2. Money - will wealth make you happy
    - Ed Diener looked at correlation between "life satisfaction" and income
        - mean correlation is about 0.10
        - implication: once basic needs statisfied, extra money does not help very much with satisfaction
    - Daniel  Kahneman and Agnes Deacon find threshold in income (~$75k), above which do not get much increase in happiness
    - Does money make us happier? A: Maybe a little bit, but way less than we actually think.

3. Awesome Stuff, True Love, Perfect Body, Good Grades
    - material goods/wealth do not increase happiness. Positive effects are evanescent
    - thinking about stuff (matierialist attitudes) makes us worse off 
    - Similarly for True love, Perfect Face/Body, certain status "achievements" (e.g. grades)icted ex ante

#### Why We have Misconceptions
- We are "clueless" about what _will_ make us happy
- S. Lyubomirsky _How of Happiness_: "genes and circumstances don't matter as much for happiness as we think"
        - genetic setpoint 50% (a substantial amount, but "only about 50%")
        - circumstances (life happens) 10% (surprisingly small influence)
        - actions and thoughts 40% 
- we can work hard to be happier. 
- the problem is that we seem to be working toward the wrong things 

#### Annoying Features of the Mind That Lead Us Astray:
1. our minds strongest intuitions are often totally wrong
2, We are all mis-predicting how we will feel (errors/biases in Affective Forecasting)
    - Mis-predict How long positive or negative response will last (Durability Bias)

### 4. Strategies to Reset Our Expectations

#### Power of Gratitude (R. Emmons)
- gratitude has power to heal, energize and change lives
- **grateful person** is able to accept all of life as a gift, or potential gift (vs. life as a burden)
- grateful people become more generous, outgoing, helpful
- Approach: write things down; take picture; take time to experience gratitude and appreciate
#### Savoring
- Savoring = stepping out of your experience, to review and appreciate it while it's happening.
- savoring benefits
    - thwarts hedonic adaptation
    - thwarts mind-wandering
    - promotes gratitude


### 05 Summary - Five things that we should want but don't often prioritize as highly
1. promoting kindness,
2. increasing social connection, 
3. finding time affluence (prioritizing (free) time),
4. meditation (thought/mind control: finding ways to control our thoughts so that we stay in the here and now,
5. healthy practices of sleep and exercise

### 06 How to Put Ideas Into Practice
- Aviod GI Joe Fallacy: Recognize that Knowing is _not_ half the battle
- strategies to put these things into practice
    - develop Situational Support by Design of Environment 
        - (remove distractions/temptations, keep reminders and aids readily at hand)
    - engage people to help you with positive habits, and grow social connections
    - Set specific Goals, prepare with WOOP
        1. Wish for specific goal specificity
        2. Outcome Visualization, with benefits
        3. Obstacle Visualization ("Mental Contrasting"): thinking about goal in terms of outcomes and obstacles
        4. Plan for response to obstacles and distractions with If-Then response rules
