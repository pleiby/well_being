## Five Main Themes
1. Misconceoptions About Happiness (our goals are not going to make us as happy as we think)
2. Why our Expectations are So Bad (biases that lead you astray)
3. What Stuff Really Increases Happiness
4. Strategies to Reset Our Expectations, Avoid Miswanting and Hedonic Adaptation
5. Putting Strategies Into Practice


## 01. Things we Think Will Make Us Happy But Don't
1. Good Job (high pay, that you care abourt)
    - Gilbert et al 1998 showed that actual unhappiness for not getting job was much less that candidate predicted ex ante
    - Lyubomirsky (How of Happiness) found there was no stable objective salary numberd you need to be happy, , it shifted up as more was earned.
    - Many of our evaluations are _relative_, not absolute (Hedonic Treadmill)
2. Money - will wealth make you happy
    - Ed Diener mean correlation between "life satisfaction" and income is about 0.10
        - implication: once basic needs statisfied, extra money does not help very much with satisfaction
    - Daniel  Kahneman and Agnes Deacon find threshold in income (~$75k), above which do not get much increase in happiness
    - Does money make us happier? A: Maybe a little bit, but way less than we actually think.
3. Awesome Stuff, True Love, Perfect Body, Good Grades
    - material goods/wealth do not increase happiness. Positive effects are evanescent
    - thinking about stuff (materialist attitudes) makes us worse off (Nickerson et al 2003)
    - Similarly for True love, Perfect Face/Body, certain status "achievements" (e.g. grades), let important/satisfying than predicted ex ante

## 02. Why We have Misconceptions
#### We are "clueless" about what _will_ make us happy
- we are subject to "miswanting" (Wilson and Gilbert): we tend to want the wrong things
    - we think we want certain things, but after working for them, we don't get as much out of them as we 
- Attitude makes us happy as much or more than things and circustances
- S. Lyubomirsky _How of Happiness_: "genes and circumstances don't matter as much for happiness as we think"
    - genetic setpoint 50% (a substantial amount, but "only about 50%")
    - circumstances (life happens) 10% (surprisingly small influence)
    - actions and thoughts 40% 
- the problem is that we seem to be working toward the wrong things 
    - (most of the goals we think will make us happy, will not really make us happy)
- we can work hard to be happier. 

#### Annoying Features of the Mind That Lead Us Astray:
1. Our minds strongest intuitions (regarding how we will feel) are often totally wrong
2. We are all **mis-predicting** how we will feel (errors/biases in Affective Forecasting)
    - Mis-predict How long positive or negative response will last (**Durability Bias** Gilbert et al 1998)
    - Gilbert: **impact bias** is in part attributable to "synthetic happiness":  humans ability to change their view of the world to be more satisfied with it.
    - Consider - "The unanticipated joy of being totally stuck" (Gilbert) vs. choice/flux
3. **Hedonic Adaptation** (Good/bad feelings for prospective outcomes are overestimated, both in duration and magnitude)
    - In addition to ex post adaptation/habituation, ex ante we all suffer **"Focal" effect**, where we do not consider other, compensating or distracting conditions that will occur
4. Relative valuations rather than absolute (**Hedonic Treadmill**)
    - choice of _reference points_ for relative judgement matters, can be illusory/elusive, and affects happiness

## 03. Summary - Six things that we should want but don't often prioritize as highly
1. opportunities for **kindness, generosity** (Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Morton _Happy Money_ 2008)
2. increasing **social connection**,  (people overseek, and overestimate benefit of solitude)
3. finding **time affluence** (prioritizing free time), (Whillans et al 2016, Hirschfeld)
4. **meditation (thought/mind control)**: finding ways to control our thoughts so that we stay in the here and now
    - "A wandering mind is an unhappy mind" Gilbert. The ability to think about what is not happening is a cognitive acheivement that comes at a cost
5. **healthy practices** of sleep and exercise
6. **Flow** Features of Flow:
    - feels challenging, but manageable
    - focused concentration on activity
    - that is intrinsically rewarding/worthwhile

## 04. Strategies to Reset Our Expectations, Avoid Miswanting and Hedonic Adaptation
1. Investing in experiences rather than "stuff" (for which hedonic adaptation is greater)
    - more easily shared, less subject to social comparison, less subject to predictive error (Pchelin & Howell 2014)
2. Varing Routine or Setting to **reset reference points**, reframe, and **avoid adaptation**
    - Forestalling Hedonic Apaptations by Savoring, **Negative Visualization**, Imagining a day as your last
    - Interrupt Your Good Times: reset reference point/avoid hedonic adaptation by spaciong out the good events, to better appreciate them
    - Increase Your Variety (of activities and consumption)
- breaks up adaptation and changes reference point
    - Reset reference by **revisiting**, taking time to imagine/recall reality of previous situation
3. ID your "signature strengths" [Seligman (2005)] and seeking jobs/activities that utilize them
    - Intentionally exercise your signature strengths frequently, in new ways
    - Similarly, seek jobs/activities that promote "flow" (Chikszentmihalyi)
4. Power of **Gratitude** (R. Emmons)
    - gratitude has power to heal, energize and change lives
    - *grateful person* is able to accept all of life as a gift, or potential gift (vs. life as a burden)
    - grateful people become more generous, outgoing, helpful
    - Approaches: write things down; take pictures; take time to experience gratitude and appreciate; thank people
5. **Savoring**
    - Savoring = stepping out of your experience, to review and appreciate it while it's happening.
    - Focus on positive aspects of experiences and share with others (in moderation)
    - Benefits of savoring: thwarts hedonic adaptation; thwarts mind-wandering; promotes gratitude
6. **Prioritize known goods**: kindness/generosity; free time; social connection; mind control; healthy practices
7. **Avoid Social Comparisons** - Be conscious of the social reference points you are letting in
    - cancel/suspend/minimize social media



### 05 How to Put Ideas Into Practice
- Avoid GI Joe Fallacy: Recognize that Knowing is _not_ half the battle
    - simply knowing will not change perceptions or behavior[^ See Santos & Gendler (2014). [Knowing is half the battle?](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25436) Edge.]
- strategies to put these things into practice
    - (effortful) strategies can address these cognitive biases
    - develop **Situational Support** by **Design of Environment** 
        - (remove distractions/temptations, keep reminders and aids for goals readily at hand)
    - engage people to help you with positive habits, and grow social connections
        - make commitments, bets/contracts
    - plan for interventions in counterproductive situations
    - **"Implementation Intention"** self-regulatory strategy in the form of specific "If - then" rule that leads to better goal attainment (Peter Gollwitzer)
    - Set specific Goals, prepare with **WOOP**
        1. Wish for specific goal specificity
        2. Outcome Visualization, with benefits
        3. Obstacle Visualization ("Mental Contrasting"): thinking about goal in terms of outcomes and obstacles
        4. Plan for response to obstacles and distractions with If-Then response rules
- **Keep filling the leaky tire** - Epley found these recommended behaviors improve happiness in the current time, but must be renewed
    > "the way to think about these things and about happiness more generally it's like a leaky tire. You just kind of got to keep pumping air into it to keep it inflated." Epley
- Summary (Gilbert The surprising science of happiness, Feb 2004)
    > "The lesson I want to leave you with, from these data, is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown, because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience."
