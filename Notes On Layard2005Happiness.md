Notes On Layard2005Happiness
=============================

Happiness: Lessons From A New Science, by Richard Layard, 2005, Penguin Books.

(A thoughtful review of what has been learned about the foundations of individual happiness, how those results match with the bedrock assumptions of classical economic analysis (poorly), and which this implies for the discipline of economics given that it has many useful concepts but basically misunderstood the objective function to be maximized (individual preferences and utilities are not separable from those of other individuals, and are not even monotonic in wealth. That is the utility of wealth (and other goods) reflects the effects of both relative comparison to others and habituation to recently experienced levels).

1. Preface
    1. "But economics equates changes in the happiness of a society with changes in its purchasing power - or roughly so. I have neverf accepted that view, and the history of the last fify years has disproved it."
        1. (IS this akin to the ProgressParadox?)
    1. Layard seeks an evidence-based reconsideration of "what lifestyles and policies are sensible, drawing on the new psycholog, as well as on economics, brain science, sociology and philosophy." [p. ix]
    1. He seeks a "new perspective, where people's feelings are treated as paramount.

1. Chapter 1 What is the Problem
    1. "There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. Most people want more income and strive for it. Yet as Western societies have got richer, their people have become no happier." [p. 3]
        1. "But aren't our lives infinitely more comfortable? Indeed [more food, clothes, housing, holidays, better health] ... Yet we are not happier." [p. 3]
        1. "One thing is clear: once subsistence income is guaranteed, making people happier is not easy." [p. 4]
    1. "The main evidence comes from the new psychology of happiness, but neuroscience, sociology, economics and philosophy all plat their part." [p. 4]
    1. Key philosophical idea of interest: "eighteenth-century Enlightenment, as articulated by Jeremy Bentham."
        1. Greatest Happiness Principle: "The best society is that where the citizens are happiest. So the best public policy is that which produces the greatest happiness." The right moral action is that which produces the most happiness for the people it affects. [p. 5]
            1. Fundamentally egalitarian, counting each person's happiness equally
            1. Noble idea that was never easy to apply, because little known about the nature and causes of happiness [or its measurement.] [p. 5]
        1. Layard contrasts Enlightenment and the Happiness Principle with the "Non-philosophy of Rampant Individualism." [p. 5]
            1. Rampant Individualism took hold in the void that opened in the twentieth century during the decline of both religious concepts of morality as well as socialism.
            1. offered an ideal of "self-realization"
            1. "It did not increase happiness, because it made each individual too anxious about what he could get for himself. If we really want to be happy, we need some concept of a common good, towards which we all contribute." [p. 5]
        1. Layard concludes that tide is now turning, in search of a concept of the common good, consistent with the Enlightenment ideal
            1. Defines the common good as "the greatest happiness of all"
            1. "requiring us to care for others as well as ourselves." [thus a notion of interdependent utility.]
    1. Key Psychological concepts derive from empirical, scientific research on happiness
        1. provides real insight into nature and causes of happiness
        1. indicates that happiness can be measured by asking people or by brain monitoring
        1. helps "separate out the facgtors that really count" for level of happiness (experienced quality of life)
            1. some factors external, from society
            1. some work from inside
    1. Social or Policy Message, and Implications
        1. Layard asks "So how, as a society, can we influence whether people are happy?" [p. 6]
            1. [This is the central question of both welfare analysis and normative public policy.]
        1. He contrasts the classical economics approach of reliance on functioning markets and incentives with an alternative based on a modern scientific understanding of the determinants of happiness
            1. Classical economics and public policy approach
                1. Based on "theoretical reasoning, using elementary economics" [p. 6]
                1. "This concludes that selfish behavior is all right provided markets are allowed to function: through the invisible hand, perfect markets will leas us to the greates happiness that is possible, given our wants and resources."
                1. Notes that peoples wants [preferences] are taken as given
                1. National income becomes proxy for national happiness
                1. Governments role becomes to correct market imperfections, remove barriers to factor mobility
                1. "This view of national happiness is the one that dominates the thinking and pronouncements of leaders of Western governments." [p. 7]
            1. Alternative approach to happiness measurement and policy
                1. Consider evidence on what actually makes people happy
                1. Malleability/adapatility and interdependence of preferences: "Our wants are not given, in the way that elementary economics assumes. In fact they depend heavily on what other people have, and on what we ourselves have got accustomed to."
                1. Wants influenced by education, advertising, media
                1. Wants driven by desire to keep up with others
                    1. leads to self-defeating **status races**
                1. "People desperately want **security**."
                    1. This necessarily depends in part on external forces beyond the individual's control
                1. "People want to **trust** other people."
                    1. this goal challenged by mobility and anonymity
                1. "We are inherently **social**, and **our happiness depends above all on the quality of our relationships with other people**. We have to develop public policies that take this 'relationship factor' into account."
                1. [earlier Layard also mentions the historical context of happiness: [past experiences and accustomization]
    1. Personal Aspects of Happiness, and Message for Individuals
        1. Inner and personal factors also drive happiness
            1. Happiness depends on our attitudes
                1. Viktor Frankl: "everything can be taken from a man bu on thing, the last of human freedoms 1. to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."
            1. Evidence indicates people are happier if they are:
                1. compassionate
                1. thankful
            1. Humans teachers and thinkers have long sought ways to instill these "traits of compassion and acceptance."
            1. Layard acknowledeges that "Many of the ideas are as old as Buddhism and have recurred throughout the ages...."
            1. Now there is scientific study of these traits, and newer ideas such as "cognitive therapy" and "positive psychology" which provide methods two promote helpful attitudes.
    1. Recap:
        1. "Human beings have largely conquered nature, but they have still to conquer themselves. In the last fifty years we have eliminated absolute material scarcity in the West. ... But in the meantime we in the West are no happier. Changing this is the new challenge and the new frontier 1. and much more difficult than wealth creation."

1. Chapter 2: What is Happiness
    1. Brain activity and happiness
        1. Late 19th century studies of brain injuries indicated that damage on left side of brain were more likely to be depressed, "damage on right side of the brain could sometimes produce elation." [p. 11]
            1. (Note similarity to Bolte-Taylor, "My Stroke of Insight")
        1. Broad picture: [p. 11]
            1. Good feelings experienced through activity on left-had side behind the forehead
            1. Bad feelings connected with brain activity behind RHS of forehead.
    1. Measurement and interpersonal comparability of happiness
        1. Measurement and interpersonal comparability of happiness are critical to whether the Bentham principle of maximum happiness can ever be pursued.
        1. Layard reports that happiness is a meaningful attribute that can be reported by individuals and compared across people.
            1. People do know how they feel: subjestive statements and objective measurements are consistent and equally valid
        1. Reported Happiness
            1. In response to standardized questions ("Taking all things together, would you say you are very happy, quite happy, happy, or not very happy?"), the distribution of reponses is very similar in U.S. and Britain, and similar between males and females.
            1. Independent ratings of an individual's happiness (provided by friends or colleagues) prove to be "well related" to self-ratings.
            1. Reported happiness varies substantially based on category of activity, with working and commuting near the bottom (rated 2.6-2.7), and sex at the top (4.7) followed by socializing, relaxing, praying/meditating, eating and exercising (3.8-4.0) (see table, p. 15)
            1. Reported happiness follows a cycle each [work?] day, generally rising through the day [peaking after dinner to bedtime]
            1. While happiness at any point in time is influenced by memories and anticipation, Layard's focus is the individuals longer-term average happiness.
            1. Based on reports of these types, Layard notes happiness depends on:
                1. To some extent our pattern of activities
                1. but Mainly
                    1. Our basic temperment and attitudes
                    1. key features of our life situation: relationships, health, and worries about money
        1. Brainwave measurements of Happiness
            1. These measurements address doubt that "happiness is really an objective feeling that can be properly compared between people."
            1. There is a direct connection between brain activity and mood
            1. "So a natural measure of happiness is the difference in activity between the left and right sides of the forebrain. This varies closely with many measures of self-reported mood." [p. 19]
            1. Finding: those who are "naturally happy" at show gretest increase in this happiness measure for good experiences, least discomfort for bad.
            1. Other region of brain associated with emotion is amygdala, but this is thought be associate with more primitive, and unconscious responses to alarming stimuli. Frontal lobes are associated with conscious experience.
            1. "So brain science confirms the objective character of happiness [and pain]." Reported pain and pleasure, compared to brain measurements "confirms the link between what people report and objective brain activity." [p. 20]
        1. Question: is happiness multidimensional?
            1. Consider the disparate emotions of being loved, achievement, discovery, tranquility, comfort, joy, fear, anger, sadness, guilt, boredom ....
            1. Layard notes 2 distinct dimensions of feeling: Happiness and Arousal. Scales are Happy/unhappy vs Aroused/Unaroused
            1. However, he argues that happiness in 1-dimensional in that the various forms of pleasure and pain can be compared, and that it is not generally possible for positive and negative feelings to be simultaneously active ("to be both happy and unhappy at the same time.") [p. 21]
            1. This (empirically supported) concept of happiness is distinct from some philosophical concepts (Aristotle, J.S. Mill) that there are higher (and more virtuous) forms of happiness.
                1. Experiments show that purpose and meaning are important sources of happiness, in fact are highly correlated with self-reported happiness and satisfaction (Carol Ryff, U. Wis).
                1. However Layard asserts Mill "was wrong to argue that some types of happiness are intrisically better than other." [p. 23]
                1. "But no good feeling is bad in itself 1. it can only be bad because of its consequences." [p. 23]
        1. The Function of Happiness
            1. Happiness exists and it is good for health (and survival)
            1. "But that does not make it supremely important. It is supremely important because it is our overall motivational device." p. 24 (seeking happiness/pleasure, and avoiding pain)
            1. Thus, Layard essentially defines happiness as that which motivates us.
            1. This is analogous to the definition and assumed role of utility in economic theory for the behavior of the individual consumer
            1. Note that long-run and short-run "happiness" may be very different.
            1. Issue: "whether we [humans] have any overall system of motivation," or are there separate drives that we respond to independently?
                1. "When one source of satisfaction becomes more costly relative to another, we choose less of it. This is the co-called law of demand." [p. 25]
