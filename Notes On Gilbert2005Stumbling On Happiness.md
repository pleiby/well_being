============================================

Gilbert, Daniel 2005. Stumbling on Happiness, ((c) 2005, Vintage Press Edition, Jan. 2007), (New York: Vintage Books).

- "One cannot forecast no divine the conditions that will make happiness; one only stumbles upon them by chance, in a lucky hour, at the world's end somewhere, and holds fast to the days, as to fortune or to fame." Willa Cather, "Le Lavandou," 1902.
- "We treat out future selves as though they were out children, spending most of the hours of most of our days constructing tomorrows that we hope will make them happy." (pp. xiii-xiv.)
- Future selves might reasonably ask what we were thinking, since things we strive for may not make our future selves happy.
- Question Gilbert addresses:
    - "How can this happen? Shouldn't we know the tastes, preferences, needs and desires of the people we wil be next year - or at least later this afternoon?" [p. xv]
    - This seems another basis for intertemporal inconsistency: no so much changing preferences, but poor foresight regarding how an outcome will be experienced and appreciated.
- "Why do they [our future selves] experience regret and relief when they think about us, rather than pride and appreciation?... Is there something wrong with them? Or is there something wrong with us?" [p. xv]
- Gilbert's ultimate answer seems to be both: both our prospective imaginations and retrospective memories are subject to critical congnitive shortcomings and failures.
- The interesting feature about these mistakes is not that they happen, but that they happen in consistent ways to many people, like the mistakes of optical illusions.
    - "The mistakes we make when we try to imagine our personal futures are also lawful, regular, and systematic. They too have a pattern that tells us about the powers and limits of foresight in much the same way that optical illusions tell us about the powers and limits of eyesight." [p. xvi.]
- Gilbert's goal is to decribe "what science has to tell us about how and how well the human brain can imagine its own future, and about how and how well it can predict which of those futures it will most enjoy. ... toi explain why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become." [p. xvii]

### Chap. 1 ("Journey to Elsewhen")
- The Sentence that all psychologist write at some point: "The human being is the only animal that ...."
- Gilbert: "The human being is the only animal that thinks about the future." p. 4]
    - "... this simple, ubiquitous, ordinary act is a defining feature or our humanity." [p. 4]
- "The greatest achievement of the human brain is its ability to imagine objects and episodes that do not exist...." [p. 5]
- The human brain is an "anticipation machine."
